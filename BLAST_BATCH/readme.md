Running multiple blast jobs in parallel by submitting them to the WEB interface. Circumvents the ressource restrictions of the API (Still keep in mind to not overload BLAST since it is a shared ressource).
Sometimes a bit buggy since it opens multiple headless browser windows in the background - rerun with residual sequences (see coments in jupyter)

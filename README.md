Content of BioHive:
- 
- Pairwise Identity between two fasta files (__pairwise_alignment.py__)
- Color code tree with evolution of amino acid position (__ITOL_point_evo__)
- Simple way to visualize potential positions for purifying, diversifying and differential selection by looking at the difference between DMS data and propensities at each position (__dms_evo.py__)
- GUI for reciprocal best hit between two sets of proteins with option to predict microbial effector proteins with EffectorP or get an approximation by looking at potential signal peptides and the subsequent localization (__Reciprocal-Best-Hit-Blast-GUI__)
- Extract promotor sequences from provided genome defined as 5' upstream region of provided genes (__promotor_extractor__)
- Blast batch query in parallel using the NCBI servers (__BLAST_BATCH__)
- Design pair of primers to introduce point mutation in the given sequence (__design_primer.py__)
